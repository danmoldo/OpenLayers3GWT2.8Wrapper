# Wrapper of OpenLayers 3 using the new JsInterop from GWT 2.8

This is a wrapper over [OpenLayers 3](http://openlayers.org/ "OpenLayers 3 website") using JsInterop v1.0: Nextgen GWT/JavaScript Interoperability

The project has two modules:
  * a GWT wrapper over OpenLayers 3 (gwt28-ol3-wrapper)
  * a showcase of what the wrapper can do (gwt28-ol3-demo)

You can build the application using Maven and you can run it using `mvn gwt:run` from the gwt28-ol3-demo module.

This project is still work in progress so stay tuned.
